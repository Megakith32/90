/**
 * Stores downloaded files. Files are named by their SHA-256 hashes. We use a SQLite database for file metadata: which
 * files are currently being downloaded, when they were most recently accessed, and what the total on-disk cost is.
 *
 * ### Cache Size
 *
 * The [maxSizeInBytes] limit applies to the content of the files in the `READY` state. It doesn't account for the size
 * of the metadata DB, or any in-flight downloads. Use a smaller [maxSizeInBytes] if you have a strict on-disk limit.
 *
 *
 * ### State Machine
 *
 * ```
 *            download
 *              start
 *         --------------->
 *  (absent)                 DIRTY
 *         <---------------
 *    ^       download       | download
 *    |        failed        | success
 *    |                      |
 *    |                      v
 *    '------------------ READY
 *           pruned
 * ```
 *
 * Note that absent entries are not present in SQLite.
 *
 * This cache is safe for concurrent use within a single process. If multiple callers attempt to mark the same absent
 * file as `DIRTY` simultaneously, all but one will fail and return false.
 *
 * This cache does not prevent multiple processes from accessing the cache simultaneously. Don't do this; it'll corrupt
 * the cache and behavior is undefined.
