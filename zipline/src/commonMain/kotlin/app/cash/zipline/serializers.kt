/**
 * Returns a [KSerializer] for [T] that performs pass-by-reference instead of pass-by-value. This is
 * only necessary when a service is passed as a member of another serializable type; Zipline
 * automatically does pass-by-reference for service parameters and return values.
 *
 * To use this, first register the serializer for your service in a
 * [kotlinx.serialization.modules.SerializersModule].
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val mySerializersModule = SerializersModule {
 *   contextual(EchoService::class, ziplineServiceSerializer())
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Next, use that [kotlinx.serialization.modules.SerializersModule] when you create your Zipline
 * instance, in both the host application and the Kotlin/JS code:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val zipline = Zipline.create(dispatcher, mySerializersModule)
 * ```
 *
 * Finally, annotate the service property with [kotlinx.serialization.Contextual]. This instructs
 * Kotlin serialization to use the registered serializer.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * @Serializable
 * data class ServiceCreatedResult(
 *   val greeting: String,
 *   @Contextual val service: EchoService,
 * )
 * ```
 *
 * The caller must call [ZiplineService.close] when they are done with the returned service to
 * release the held reference.
