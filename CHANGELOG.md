# Change Log

## [Unreleased]


## [0.9.6] - 2022-10-13

We've changed this project to focus exclusively on executing Kotlin/JS libraries.

We plan to drop support for executing arbitrary JavaScript code. If you've been using either
QuickJS Java (this project's name until September 2021) or Duktape Android (this project's name
until June 2021), those projects remain as git branches but will not receive further updates.

The project's new Maven coordinates are `app.cash.zipline:zipline`.

 * Fix: Don't fail with `unexpected call` errors because code was not being rewritten by our Kotlin
   compiler plugin.


## [0.9.5] - 2022-10-06

 * New: Support `@Contextual` as a type annotation on `ZiplineService` parameters and return types.
   This will attempt to find a contextual serializer for the annotated type.
 * Breaking: Rename `LoadedZipline` to `LoadResult`. This allows `ZiplineLoader.load()` to return
   a flow that includes both successes and failures.
 * Breaking: Remove `eval()` support from QuickJs. As a security measure Zipline doesn't support
   evaluating JavaScript at runtime.


## [0.9.4] - 2022-09-07

 * New: Build in a basic HTTP client for Apple platforms.
 * Breaking change: Wrap exceptions thrown in bridged calls with `ZiplineException`. Previously
   these were wrapped in `Exception` which was difficult to catch generically.


## [0.9.3] - 2022-08-23

 * Breaking change: Move `SerializersModule` from a property of `ZiplineLoader` to a parameter in
   `load()` and `loadOnce()`. This enables using a single loader for different applications that
   have different serializers.
 * Breaking change: Make `ZiplineCache` a top-level type. It has its own lifecycle and is best
   managed directly.
 * Breaking change: Pass a `startValue` parameter consistently to event listener callbacks.
 * New: Extension `OkHttpClient.asZiplineHttpClient()` makes it easier to use general-purpose
   Zipline APIs from multiplatform code.


## [0.9.2] - 2022-08-22

 * Breaking change: `ZiplineLoader.load(...)` is no longer suspending.
 * Breaking change: Don't require implementors of `ZiplineHttpClient` to implement URL resolution.
 * Breaking change: Include a default clock implementation on iOS.
 * Breaking change: Require callers to explicitly opt out of signature checks. Pass
   `ManifestVerifier.Companion.NO_SIGNATURE_CHECKS` to use `ZiplineLoader` without code signature
   verification.
 * New: Support ECDSA P-256 for signatures.


## [0.9.1] - 2022-08-18

 * New: Gradle extension `zipline {}` block.
 * New: Compile files in parallel.
 * New: Replace webpack with a dedicated static file server. Use `serveDevelopmentZipline` or
   `serveProductionZipline` to serve an application locally.
 * Fix: Always run Kotlin/JS in strict mode.
 * Upgrade: [Kotlin Serialization 1.4.0][kotlin_serialization_1_4_0].


## [0.9.0] - 2022-08-05

 * New: `ZiplineLoader` is a new module to launch Zipline applications quickly. It supports caching
   including offline launching, code signing, and launching from a flow.
 * New: Zipline's Gradle plugin makes it fast and easy to use build Zipline applications.
 * New: `EventListener` makes it easy to observe with Zipline performance and problems.
 * Upgrade: [Kotlin 1.7.10][kotlin_1_7_10].


## [0.1.0] - 2021-09-30

### Added

* `Zipline` is a new entry point for connecting to Kotlin/JS libraries.
* `ZiplineReference` supports sending service objects across platforms.
* `ZiplineSerializer` supports sending serializers objects across platforms.
* `FlowReference` supports sending `Flow` objects across platforms.
* `InterruptHandler` interrupts executing JavaScript.
* `MemoryUsage` interrogates the state of the JavaScript runtime.

### Changed

* `QuickJs` entry point moved to `app.cash.zipline`.


# QuickJS Java change log

## [0.9.2] - 2021-08-04

### Added

* `compile()` method takes JS source and produces a version-specific bytecode representation.
* `execute()` method takes version-specific bytecode and runs it.


### Changed

* Methods are no longer `synchronized`. If you are performing concurrent access add your own synchronization.


### Fixed

* Self-extract native libraries from JAR when running on the JVM.
* Correct UTF-8 handling of multi-byte graphemes to avoid mismatch between Java's modified UTF-8 and QuickJS's traditional UTF-8.


## [0.9.1] - 2021-07-12

JVM artifact is now available at `app.cash.quickjs:quickjs-jvm` for Linux and Mac OS!

### Fixed

* Handle null argument array which was sometimes supplied to native code instead of a zero-element array.
* Properly track the associated proxy class from native code to avoid a segfault.
* Eliminate a segfault during engine close when cleaning up proxied objects.


## [0.9.0] - 2021-06-14

Backing JS engine change to QuickJS.
Package name is now `app.cash.quickjs`.
Entrypoint is `QuickJs` class.
Maven coordinates are now `app.cash.quickjs:quickjs-android`.
The API and behavior should otherwise be unchanged.
