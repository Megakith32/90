# Change Log

## [Unreleased]


## [0.1.0] - 2021-09-30

We've changed this project to focus exclusively on executing Kotlin/JS libraries.

We plan to drop support for executing arbitrary JavaScript code. If you've been using either
QuickJS Java (this project's name until September 2021) or Duktape Android (this project's name
until June 2021), those projects remain as git branches but will not receive further updates.

The project's new Maven coordinates are `app.cash.zipline:zipline`.


### Added

* `Zipline` is a new entry point for connecting to Kotlin/JS libraries.
* `ZiplineReference` supports sending service objects across platforms.
* `ZiplineSerializer` supports sending serializers objects across platforms.
* `FlowReference` supports sending `Flow` objects across platforms.
* `InterruptHandler` interrupts executing JavaScript.
* `MemoryUsage` interrogates the state of the JavaScript runtime.

### Changed

* `QuickJs` entry point moved to `app.cash.zipline`.


# QuickJS Java change log

## [0.9.2] - 2021-08-04

### Added

* `compile()` method takes JS source and produces a version-specific bytecode representation.
* `execute()` method takes version-specific bytecode and runs it.


### Changed

* Methods are no longer `synchronized`. If you are performing concurrent access add your own synchronization.


### Fixed

* Self-extract native libraries from JAR when running on the JVM.
* Correct UTF-8 handling of multi-byte graphemes to avoid mismatch between Java's modified UTF-8 and QuickJS's traditional UTF-8.


## [0.9.1] - 2021-07-12

JVM artifact is now available at `app.cash.quickjs:quickjs-jvm` for Linux and Mac OS!

### Fixed

* Handle null argument array which was sometimes supplied to native code instead of a zero-element array.
* Properly track the associated proxy class from native code to avoid a segfault.
* Eliminate a segfault during engine close when cleaning up proxied objects.


## [0.9.0] - 2021-06-14

Backing JS engine change to QuickJS.
Package name is now `app.cash.quickjs`.
Entrypoint is `QuickJs` class.
Maven coordinates are now `app.cash.quickjs:quickjs-android`.
The API and behavior should otherwise be unchanged.
