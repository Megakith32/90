/**
 * Returns an 8-character base64-encoded SHA-256 hash.
 *
 * The hash function, length, and base64 are chosen to avoid collisions for most interface
 * definitions (usually less than 100 functions), while minimizing encoded length.
 *
 * Note that no hashing occurs at runtime. Instead, function signatures are hashed in the Zipline
 * Kotlin compiler plugin and the outputs of those hashes are inlined in the generated code.
 *
 * The probability of a collision in a service declaring 1,000 functions is 0.000,000,002. This
 * is not a security mechanism and an attacker seeking to create a collision could name their
 * functions to do so.
 *
 * Don't change how this works! Doing so will break upgrades for programs compiled with different
 * identifiers.
